# To prevent cyclic dependency error
# use "import package" instead of "from package import class"
# otherwise error will be raised if class has not yet defined (the package is partial defined)
# Use lazy import when defining model field class,
# so we can avoid referencing a class that has not been defined (the package is partial defined)
# But we can safely use direct class reference in function since it is not evaluate
# until the runtime
